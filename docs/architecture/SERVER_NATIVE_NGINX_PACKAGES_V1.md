# Native NGINX package preview and signed-metadata probe v1 (#27)

**Status:** unmerged, non-installing #27 development implementation.
The `server_native_package_plan_v1.py` preview is intentionally inert.
The separate `server_native_package_trust_v1.py` can explicitly query actual
native APT/DNF signed repository metadata and NGINX candidates but **cannot
authorize** an install or claim package payload authenticity. Neither module
delivers operational NGINX installation, service activation or server
provisioning.

## Fixed package intent

| Supported host | Native manager | Distribution-supplied package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debian 13 / Python 3.13 | APT | nginx |
| AlmaLinux 10 / Python 3.12 | DNF | nginx |

The preview_nginx_packages function revalidates the closed v1 install schema
and native OS/Python identity, then returns only the fixed package selection
and five **NOT VERIFIED** gates. The operator cannot submit package names,
shell commands, repositories, trusted keys or flags through
deployment.native_packages, which permits only policy=explicit-review. The
package list is a reviewed target, not proof that a package is available,
authentic, current or safe to install.

The report is deterministic, contains only static English remediation and
allowlisted package names, and always returns can_install=false,
all_verified=false and authorizes_installation=false. It never invokes
APT/DNF, refreshes metadata, contacts a network service, writes files,
checks package trust, claims NGINX ownership or asks for privilege. It is not
yet wired into the public deployment preflight command, which remains a
separate partial, permanently non-authorizing observation.

## Native signed-metadata probe (development-only; not an install gate)

`server_native_package_trust_v1.inspect_native_nginx_metadata()` is a
separately invoked, non-installing **native package-manager probe**. It is not
wired into #26's strictly no-network preflight or any privileged provisioning
entrypoint. It rejects unsupported OS/Python or unreviewed v1 policy before
external execution. It uses a newly created temporary directory per run and
the fixed distro package-manager binaries, a stripped environment, bounded
timeouts and static redacted diagnostics. Scratch contents are removed after
the attempt; external network access and temporary files **do occur**.

For Debian 13 the probe uses fixed official Debian trixie/trixie-updates and
trixie-security source endpoints, the OS-owned Debian archive keyring and
apt-secure signature validation through a fresh isolated `apt-get update`.
Insecure/unauthenticated/downgrade-to-insecure metadata and partial-update
success are explicitly refused. It then checks `apt-cache policy nginx`
against those same fresh lists, requiring an actual candidate.

For AlmaLinux 10 it selects the fixed official BaseOS/AppStream HTTPS
repositories, a preflight-checked root-owned AlmaLinux 10 key and **requires
both RPM package GPG checks and GPG-signed repository metadata**. The AlmaLinux 10 native manager is **DNF4** (not DNF5): the probe uses
`--noplugins`, `--disablerepo=*` with explicit fixed-repository re-enabling,
`gpgcheck=1` for RPM packages and `repo_gpgcheck=1` for metadata. DNF5-only
`--no-plugins` and `pkg_gpgcheck` are not accepted by the distribution's
DNF4. The DNF refresh occurs with a private installroot, repository
configuration, cache and log directory. The subsequent `repoquery --available` must find the
literal `nginx` package. Hosts whose official repository/mirror fails the
required metadata signature gate are **NOT VERIFIED**, even if DNF normally
accepts that repository with `repo_gpgcheck=0`; we do not silently lower the
requirement. GitHub-hosted synthetic fixtures cannot establish whether the
actual supported distribution repositories meet this policy.

The probe's PASS means only that **at the time of the read-only probe**
native authenticated metadata was refreshed and an NGINX candidate was
observed from its fixed allowed repositories. It is **not** proof of the
downloaded RPM/DEB payload signature, of package transaction dependencies
or final host readiness. It always returns `can_install=false`,
`payload_signature_verified=false` and `authorizes_installation=false`.
No package is downloaded for installation, installed or staged for activation;
no persistent host package-manager sources/cache are deliberately modified.

**Caveats:** a privileged execution helper must independently re-check
signatures, origins and actual package payloads immediately before the native
transaction. Distro mirror changes may require a reviewed configuration
update; this prototype intentionally refuses arbitrary operator sources.
The source scan prevents common unsafe signing-key ownership and symlink
patterns but does not substitute for complete root/LSM/namespace and
distribution package-trust acceptance.

## Mandatory downstream execution boundary (not implemented)

Before a privileged native transaction (#27), implement and separately test
all of the following, failing closed with redacted actionable errors:

1. Check effective supported OS, system Python and existing/unmanaged NGINX
   conflicts on the actual host. Never take over a third-party NGINX service.
2. Review enabled distribution-approved APT/DNF sources, provenance of
   trusted signing keys, and effective native repository/package signature
   verification. Reject third-party substitutions, trusted=yes, unsigned
   sources, gpgcheck=0, repo_gpgcheck=0 where required by approved policy,
   disabled verification, unavailable or stale metadata and offline failures.
   Native APT/DNF is authoritative; do not build a second signature verifier.
3. Verify the exact selected nginx package's availability and trusted native
   source, reporting missing/untrusted packages without leaking repository
   credentials or unreviewed source URLs. Any planning-time results may be
   stale and are **not** install approval.
4. On a **separately authorized** privileged operation, repeat the relevant
   trust and availability checks; document irreversible native package effects
   and handle partial transactions (#31). Reject failed checks before any
   NGINX/REPOCACHE configuration, service, TLS or firewall activation.
5. Only after existing-NGINX ownership, staged complete-context nginx -t,
   rollback and controlled reload gates have been proved, perform separately
   approved service activation. Preserve the previous configuration on failure.

## Disposable distro metadata validation

The PR adds `scripts/smoke_server_native_package_metadata.py` and the focused
`.github/workflows/server-native-nginx-metadata.yml` matrix. The workflow
runs the **actual native** APT/DNF metadata verification in short-lived
Debian 13 and AlmaLinux 10 Docker images and requires both to observe a trusted
NGINX candidate. When missing, the smoke step exits nonzero with a bounded,
redacted failure classification; it never prints manager stdout/stderr. The
CI-only bootstrap may install OS Python and root CA certificates **inside the
disposable container**, not on the GitHub runner or any production host.
A green result proves only tested distribution userspace/network trust at that
CI revision; a red result is not waived by earlier mocked pytest success.
Actual booted host systemd/SELinux and transaction-stage package signatures
remain untested and mandatory.

The original #27 criteria remain NOT VERIFIED: booted Debian 13 and AlmaLinux
10 installed NGINX service acceptance, re-run idempotence, no third-party
adoption, failed config/reload recovery and systemd/SELinux behavior. Tests of
this pure preview cannot satisfy those operational criteria, nor #26's
missing-package diagnostic acceptance. Do not close #26, #27, #18 or #25 based
on this source-only increment.
